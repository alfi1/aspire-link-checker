# aspire-link-checker
To check through all URLs in Aspire reading lists, and report back on any dead links.

Written in Python 3. Will run on Windows, Linux or Unix.
Because it takes so long to run, it is best to run in on a machine that you can leave alone for hours, or (better) as nohup on Linux. 

## Documentation in need of updating! 08/07/2021
I found out that the ODBC driver for Linux that I had originally chosen would cost me Â£7k in license fees!
I have rewritten the code to use a free JDBC driver.
This code needs more testing, after which I will update the documentation.


## Installation (Linux)

You will need `git`, `python3`, and `pipenv` installed on your linux machine. 
pipenv may also be available for windows, but this is untested. 

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Setup the pipenv environment - this will insall and keep all packages for this script separate from anything else you are running in python.

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```
   
3. Then enter the pipenv shell to actually run your code.

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. Now assuming you have setup your config file (see below) you are ready to go

   ```bash
   python aspire_link_check_mis.py
   ```

## Getting configured

There is a file called `config-template.yml` copy this to a new file called `config.yml` and update it with your 
specific user details.

The default configuration looks like this: You can change the SQL query here if you need to. 
Note that the default sql query includes a `LIMIT` clause so that you can try it out before you run it for real.

```yml
database:
  host: tenant-advancedmis.talis.com
  database: yourdatabasename
  username: yourusername
  password: yourpassword
sql: |
  -- the current time period for lists that have links you want to check
  -- this will be the value as you find it in the time period column of the all list items report
  SELECT
    i.item_url,
    l.title,
    i.web_address
  FROM
    f_rl_items i,
    f_rl_lists l
  WHERE i.list_guid = l.list_guid
  AND i.status = 'Published'
  AND i.web_address != ''
  AND i.time_period = '21/22'
  LIMIT 2
```

## The different files explained
There is a file for all users of Talis Aspire:

- `aspire_link_checker.py` - For sites that do NOT have Aspire Advanced MIS.
- `aspire_link_check_mis_windows.py` - For those with access to Advanced MIS, and who want to run Python in Windows.
- `aspire_link_check_mis.py` - For users of Advanced MIS, who want to run on a Windows Linux subsystem or straight Linux machine.

My preference is `aspire_link_check_mis.py`, as running the script on Linux opens up more options for scheduling via cron,
automatically emailing the results, or automatically SFTPing them to a specific location. It is the most versatile choice.

I have put instructions for installing the driver in the project wiki. Go on! Do the work in Linux!

## Instructions for using aspire_link_check_mis_windows.py or aspire_link_check_mis.py

- The code should be self-explanatory through its notes.
- Copy the code to a machine authorised for Aspire Advanced MIS,
- install the Amazon Redshift driver, 
- and any other python libraries required.

Make sure you have also copied your `config.yml` and updated it with your database connection details in the indicated locations, and fire it off.

## Instructions for using aspire_link_checker.py
Download an 'all_list_items' CSV report from Aspire.
Move aspire_link_checker.py to the directory from which you intend to run it (and the same one that contains your all_list_items*.csv).

The only line of the file that should need editing is the one that defines the source file downloaded from Aspire:
  original_filename = 'all_list_items_2021_03_11.csv'

## Run!

The script takes hours to run. By example, on 22/03/2021, I ran it against all our current reading lists. It took 12 hours to run, and detected 208 dead links.

When finished, it will output the report file 'all_items_link_report.csv', which contains:
- The http Status (always 404, unless you tweak the code)
- The reading list that contains the broken link
- The broken link itself
- The 'Item link', which is the link in Aspire from which the dead URL was called.

Feel free to tune and tweak the code. If you make it better or faster, please let me know.

You could certainly make it significantly faster by reducing the time that the script checks each URL:
  response = requests.get(final_url, timeout=15)
